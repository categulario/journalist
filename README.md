Journal Management System

Properties;

1- Editors can create journals and accept requesting authorships
2- Users can be author to any journal (if the request authorship is accepted by editor)
3- I used Editor.JS for Content Management

I did not get live this project yet. If community wants to publish it, we can deploy it with your contributions :)
